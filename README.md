Time4J
======

Advanced date and time library for Java

Motivation:
-----------

Time4J is thought as a complete and high-end replacement for old java classes around java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar and java.text.SimpleDateFormat. This project is also intended as first-class alternative to the popular libraries JodaTime and its successor JSR-310 (Threeten) since the target audience of Time4J will not only be business Java developers, but also developers with a more scientific background (for example extended time scale support including leap seconds or historically accurate dates).

Current state:
--------------

On 2013-12-14 I have published the abstact foundations of Time4J, consisting of four packages. This part can be considered relatively stable, although it is still not usable as bundle of interfaces and abstract classes. In the background I have already much more material but this still requires some finishing work in order to be published as release 0.1-alpha (which can reasonably be expected in January/February when I get some free days).

Tutorials:
----------

English tutorials and code examples will soon be presented on the website "http://www.time4j.net/".

Blog:
-----

If you are capable of German language you can also read my blog "http://www.menodata.de/blog/" where I sometimes post my views about Java and Time, for example my review of JSR-310.
